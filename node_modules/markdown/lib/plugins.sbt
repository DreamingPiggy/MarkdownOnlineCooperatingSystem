To ensure the proper sbt version is used, make sure you have the following in project/build.properties:


name := "my-first-app"

version := "1.0"

lazy val root = (project in file(".")).enablePlugins(PlayJava)
â€¦or Scala projects:

name := "my-first-app"

version := "1.0.0-SNAPSHOT"

lazy val root = (project in file(".")).enablePlugins(PlayScala)
